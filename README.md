# Animal Image Classification

This repository contains a project for classifying images of animals using a deep learning model. The model is trained on the Animals-10 dataset from Kaggle and achieves an accuracy of 97.7%.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Animals-10 dataset, which can be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10). The dataset consists of 10 classes of animals: dog, horse, cat, spider, butterfly, chicken, sheep, cow, squirrel, and elephant.

## Model

The model used for this project is EfficientNetB3, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network known for its efficiency and performance. The model is fine-tuned on the Animals-10 dataset to achieve high accuracy in classifying animal images.

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of 97.7% on the test set.
